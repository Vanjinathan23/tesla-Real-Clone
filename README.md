# ⚡ Tesla.com Full Frontend Clone

Welcome to the **Tesla.com Clone** – a 100% front-end replica of the official [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com) website.  
This project showcases a complete rebuild of Tesla’s stunning, interactive, and minimalistic website using **pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — no frameworks, no shortcuts, just raw frontend craftsmanship.

## 🌟 Why This Project?

Tesla.com is one of the cleanest and most elegant websites on the internet. Recreating it from scratch is a fantastic way to:
- Understand modern UI/UX practices
- Improve layout skills with Flexbox & Grid
- Practice animation and interaction with Vanilla JavaScript
- Master responsive web design
- Sharpen attention to detail and pixel-perfect precision

This project is part of my frontend web development portfolio and a demonstration of my capability to clone real-world, production-grade interfaces.
